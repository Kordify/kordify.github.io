# Getting Started

In this section, you will learn how to create a simple plugin.

## Requirement

Kordify was coded in Kotlin and is compiled with Java 17.
You must know Kotlin or Java to create a plugin and have a JDK compatible with Java 17 installed.
It may be possible to create a plugin with Javascript (because Kotlin is compatible with JS) but we never test this.

We strongly recommend you to utilize Gradle instead of Maven.

In this section, we will consider that you already know Kotlin and some basic concept of Discord.
If you only know Java, Kotlin is a superset of Java and is easily transposable to Java.
